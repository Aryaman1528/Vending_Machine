# Vending Machine

An ideal vending machine is made in verilog using the concept of FSMs. It allows the user to take the product and recieve change from the machine in case of extra money paid.
It has been assumed that the vending machine has only one product and the customer has currencies of denominations Rs5, Rs10 and Rs15 only.
